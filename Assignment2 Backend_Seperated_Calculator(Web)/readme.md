This repository includes the core files of the calculator_web, including two html files(frontend), views.py(backend), models.py
and a urls.py(back end).
In the actual environment, they are actually all under the folder called calculator_web.
Also, the database file is uploaded in the backend repository.
For more information, please refer to the CSDN message of mine.
